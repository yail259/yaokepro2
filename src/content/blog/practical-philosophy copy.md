Anxiety is that dryness in your mouth, that shaking hand, that racing heart, and that impulse to throw a fist or to
run away. It serves to protect us from the future, from what might happen and from the unknown. Ironically,
anxiety, just like anything else, when too high in dosage, can impair function in life, performance and cognition.

One key way to deal with this is has to do with understanding the spectrum of control. On one end of the spectrum, 
are the things fully within your control, how you breathe, how you will act physically, what you can say. In the 
middle are the things that are harder to control, where some environmental factors come into play, like whether
you will attend that meeting on time or whether you allow a friend to take a picture of you. On the other end are the
things that are fully outside of your influence, for example, whether it will rain, or if a meteor will hit Earth
tomorrow.

Life is so hard because of how hard it is to identify where on the spectrum do situations lie. And life is as always
a little harder than even that because depending on your actions and the changes in the environment, how much control
you have and what you have control over shift, sometimes drastically and unpredictably.
