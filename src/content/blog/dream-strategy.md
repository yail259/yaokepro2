Perhaps one of the most common problem I hear about plaguing others, and at times myself, is a sense of meaningless,
a sense that there is no point in living. This feeling is unmotivating, and leaves one feeling like there is not
direction in life.

My understanding is that this is actually a rather modern problem, originating from comfort. Our ancestors certainly
didn't sit around pondering the meaning of life. At least not in the same way. They were survival focused. There is
a main goal and responsibility which rests on everyone's shoulders, and that's to survive. The tiger in the jungle
certainly isn't respectfully waiting for one to be motivated.

What do we do when we are well fed, not thirsty and warm from our clothes?

This is not to say modern people don't have modern problems, we certainly do. But these new sets of problems don't 
engage our most primal, lizard parts of the brain the same way our old problems did. We don't feel the sense of 
desperation when there are no food, water or shelter, when we are down with a terrible fever with no painkillers.
My personal opinion is that this is what's causing the sense of purposeless in life. We are creatures of burden,
designed to survive, and nothing else can fill that void we inherited from our ancestors, certainly not pleasure.

For me, what has resolved this sense of purposeless has been a couple of things. For this post, I will focus on the 
idea of having a dream, and a strategy. 

# Dream

Perhaps some cringe at the idea of talking about a dream. It's definitely a message that is over-preached by every
cartoon, movie, book and poem. But I'm a firm believer that all things popular hold some truth to them, and that the
truth is often hidden or the opposite to what the message pretends to be. In this case, I believe the truth is not too
far from the preached representation, and I'll give the most accurate understanding I have of what a dream is.

A dream is a goal of outcome which you wish to achieve in the world and is not yet true. For example, a dream can be
becoming an astronaut when you are 12 years old. In essense, it is a vision of the future which is possible but requires
effort on your part to become true. This then becomes a substitute for the primal burden of survival that we used
to carry and provides one with a goal and a sense of direction. Of course, practically, this is not so simple.

There are several rules of setting a dream which makes it worthwhile to even pursue:

1. Realistic
2. Achievable for you
3. Sense of responsibility
4. Aligns with your intrinsic feelings

## (1) Realistic
A good dream has to be grounded in reality. It can't be delusional. If had a dream about becoming Superman and stopping
bullets with my bare hands, it would not be very realistic, in fact, I might as well be dreaming in my sleep. 
The dreams we want to set when we are awake can't be like this. It has to be within the realm of possibility. 
You can still aim for unlikely dreams, but it's important to distinguish between hard to achieve, and literally 
impossible. 

## (2) Achievable for you
Whilst becoming the best basketballer in the NBA is a realistic dream that many have acheived. But if you happen to be
short, or don't have access to a basketball, or are already 50 years old, it's not very realistic for you. Set a dream
which you can realistically see yourself in 5-10 years time. It can take an unbelievable amount of effort on your part,
but it has to be doable. Think climbing a really tall mountain vs magically teleporting to the top of a cliff.

## (3) Sense of responsibility
A good dream should be responsible. As fun as it would be to make your dream digging as many booby traps in your 
neighbourhood as possible, it is only to serve your own personal pleasure and entertainment. Focusing on self and 
self-improvement is critical and is part of being responsible for yourself. Inside a good dream, you should be
a better version of yourself in everyway. Beyond that, a good dream should also improve the lives of those around
you, as you begin to take responsibility for your community and wider society.

## (4) Aligns with your intrinsic feelings
No amount of dreaming will mean anything if you aren't driven to make it a reality. I believe everyone has a personal
drive which is intrinsic and allows them to overcome any difficulty or challenge thrownn at them. If you hate talking
to people, but make it your dream to become a clinical psychologist to make a bunch of money, that is a terrible dream.
You will slowly die in the process of doing it, and even if you make it, it's more like making it to the bottom of
a pit than the top of a mountain.

None of these 4 requirements are easy, but once you satisfy all 4 of them to some extent, you will end up with a
meaningful and fulfilling dream.

# Strategy

Now that you have a most excellent dream to pursue, it's time for a strategy. I watched this Harvard Business School
Youtube video on how a plan is not a strategy, and it really brought into words what I've been thinking about for a
long time. Out of a 100 people, maybe 50 of them work pretty hard. And yet out of the 50, maybe 5-10 find the 
success that they were seeking, why is that?

It seems like there is a disconnect between hardwork and achieving your desired outcome, and one of the key factors is
definitely strategy. A plan is simply a series of steps to carry out. Imagine a game of monopoly, a plan may be to
buy some houses and roll the dice well. A strategy however, involves forming alliances with your fellow players, 
analysing which houses are the most valuable to buy and re-evaluating the concrete plan at every major change in the
game's dynamic. If my dream is to become a really good teacher, a plan would be to prepare for some lessons and 
show up to class, but a strategy would be to talk to the students and understand what they are struggling with, talk
to the other teachers to get a feel for the school and finally develop a teaching plan that is catered to the situation.

Plans are easy to make. You just follow the standard procedure and take very little responsibility for the outcome. It 
is comfortable. However, for any task less trivial than vacuuming the house, it's bound to lead to a result that is 
at best average, and at worst terrible. A strategy is unsettling. It requires you to think about the situation, 
identify the factors at play, and make predictions about the future. It requires you to take responsibility for taking
the outcome to a level beyond average and admit that your strategy was wrong in case it doesn't work out. However, 
to achieve any non-trivial dream, it is a necessity in turning a vision into not just a plan, but a series of plans 
which are adaptable and functional.

This is not to say that for a 5 year plan, you should have a clear vision of what should happen in the 4th year from
January to December. Accounting for uncertainty should be a part of the strategy, and the more short-term/certain
the situation, the more concrete the strategy should be in terms of actions.

None of this is easy, but it's certainly worthwhile to master.
